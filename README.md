My partner Dillon Jones hosted the website at 4701.dillonjones.com
It is a website built on top of the chinook datatbase https://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com. It doesn't actually sell any music, nor can you listen to any demo. It is just a conceptual design. The site supports all basic funtionalities. The customer can browse all the music tracks stored in the database and order it, they can create their own playlist and add their owned tracks to it, they can checkout their order history and see the status of any of their order. The employees have the abilities to add, edit and delete tracks, manage public playlist, approve or deny customer orders and view all the customers in the database. The admin users have all the functionalities an employee has. On top of that, the admin users can change the role of any user and view the simple generated sales report.
